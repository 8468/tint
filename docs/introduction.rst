Introduction
============

Tint is an experimental communications network that enables [friend-to-friend (F2F)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend-to-friend) communication via a simple protocol.

Here are the goals:
 1. Provide a secure method for communication between trusted peers (i.e., friends) without reliance on any intermediaries or single points of failure.
 1. Provide the tools necessary to create applications that run in a browser that take advantage of being able to securely communicate with peers.
 1. Provide a simple storage mechanism that enables:
 1. Local addressible storage, ie. you store what's important to you locally and don't rely on peers to retrieve that content.
 1. Replication, ie you can store things on your friends' machines.
